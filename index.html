<h1 id="the-ghost-labs-inc">The Ghost Labs Inc</h1>
<p>The Ghost Labs Inc (short for Green Hydrogen Open Source Technologies
Labs, and referred as GHOST in the remainder of this document) is a
Massachussetts USA Not for profit (also proposed to be a world-wide
eventually subject to availability of funds), is an organization
dedicated to open source sharing, improvement, and documentation of
Green Hydrogen Technologies.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, and Therefore: All the source code, 3D printable
designs, and other artifacts submitted to GHOST shall be made available
to the general public under the GNU GPL 3
(https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html).</p>
<p>In order to make this rewarding for individuals and organizations
contributing the digital twins of their Hydrogen producing technology
devices, GHOST shall allow for timed public disclosure so that inventors
and legal owners of the technologies can have the opportunity to gain
appropriate legal protections like patents, copyrights, and trademarks
on the said works.</p>
<p>In order for the technology contributors to gain maximum marketing
advantage from the works contributed by them, GHOST shall permit them to
advertise the specific digital artifacts contributed by them in a
primary manner, with a fine print or less prominent statement indicating
support by GHOST.</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-ghost">Goals of GHOST</h3>
<p>It is the <strong>mission</strong> of GHOST to provide
<em>scientifically verifiable</em>, <em>open-source</em> and
<em>documented</em> digital artifacts with complete scientific chain of
citations or patents, in order to achieve very high level of trust,
transparency, and repeatable cost baselines for Green Hydrogen
Production.</p>
<p>It is the goal of GHOST to eventually develop a digital twin of every
electrolyzer and Hydrogen related device on the planet, and to share it
under the open source license with publicly documented
specifications.</p>
<p>The analysis and optimization of these digital twins with continuous
improvement of the optimum boundary ensures that the best technologies
are available for digital experimentation through the open source
sharing license.</p>
<h3 id="ghost-software">GHOST Software</h3>
<p>The GHOST will also provide an open source repository with interface
to integrate with, and/or to control generic electrolyzer operations.
Using this will allow the GHOST will host open source IOT feeds of the
physical electrolyzer operations.</p>
<h3 id="how-ghost-works">How GHOST Works</h3>
<p>GHOST will attempt to help any for profit corporation,
not-for-profit, or government lab under limitations of local law(s), at
a modest consulting cost, as long as they are willing to work with the
above scrutiny. This is done in order to achieve the best publicly
verifiable optimization path to Green Hydrogen Production.</p>
<p>GHOST hires consultants and researchers with expertise in various
scientific domains in order to further examine and optimize the optimum
path to massive Green Hydrogen Production.</p>
<h3 id="social-good-mission">Social Good Mission</h3>
<p>GHOST will attempt to provide physical Green Hydrogen at best cost +
delta basis, using the best documented supply chain configuration
corresponding to the digital twins provided by the various suppliers,
for the following <em>acts-of-good</em> either by itself, or by
partnering with another person or organization with appropriate skills
in the following areas of interest. Residual profits from the delta
margin and consulting fees shall be applied towards the specific
recipients indicated within:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning ocean oil-spills, plastics, and other pollutants in a
scientifically open, least cost least residual method.</li>
<li>Saving people’s life at sea, providing safe economical replacement
for heating for low-income people who are disproportionately lost in
home-heating accidents, working towards human habitable self-sufficient
energy islands for various refugees.</li>
<li>Education of students in Hydrogen welding and glass annealing,
world-wide.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>The GHOST Labs is currently under construction. Suitable hosts are
requested to contact the authors.</p>
<p>** Under Construction **</p>
<p>Appropriate locations should necessarily provide high level of
digital security, and preferably be open access to all persons in order
to provide highly transparent yet highly secure achievement of the
previously described mission. Since these two requirements are sometimes
in mutual contradiction, we prefer the first one over the second, at
least in the beginning when we do not have funds to rent and upgrade a
suitable facility on our own.</p>
<p>The location should budget 2 desk space i.e. 80 - 100 sq ft minimally
for one engineer working on the software and hardware assembly.</p>
<p>There is opportunity to train 2-3 interns in both of the above skills
and also to broaden the skill base within the team. Therefore the space
could plan for expansion within 2-6 months for this scale-up.</p>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The GHOST is created with the hope that Green Hydrogen Technologies
will improve with collaborative scientific accretion. With a transparent
cost structure, a well defined rational process for planetary scale
decarbonization may be followed, as the scale of Hydrogen production
grows.</p>
<p>The GHOST is a gift to the nation, to humanity, and is shared with
the hope that the values of universal inclusion and treating all human
beings with dignity and all life with care and love will be furthered by
its users.</p>
<p>This website is currently under construction, additional details will
be added at the earliest</p>
