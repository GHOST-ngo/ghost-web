# GHOST

DRAFT as of 2025 05 04
  
The Green Hydrogen Open Source Technologies Labs NGO (i.e. GHOST), is an organization dedicated to open source sharing, improvement, and documentation of Green Hydrogen Technologies.  All the source code and 3D printable designs submitted to GHOST shall be made available to the general public under the GNU GPL 3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html)

It is the mission of GHOST to provide scientifically verifiable, open, and documented artifacts in order to achieve very high level of trust, transparency, and repeatable cost baselines for Green Hydrogen Production.

It is the goal of GHOST to develop a digital twin of every electrolyzer and related Hydrogen handling device on the planet with publicly known specifications.  The analysis and optimization of these digital twins with continuous improvement of the optimum boundary ensures that the best technologies are available for digital experimentation through the sharing license.

The GHOST provides an interface to integrate with, or to control generic electrolyzer operations.  Using this ensures that GHOST will host open source IOT feeds of the physical electrolyzer operations.

GHOST will attempt to help any for profit corporation or government lab under limitations of local law, at a modest consulting cost, as long as they are willing to work with the above scrutiny, in order to achieve the best publicly verifiable optimization path to Green Hydrogen Production.

GHOST will attempt to hire consultants and researchers with expertise in various scientific domains to futher examine and optimize the optimum path to massive Green Hydrogen Production.  

GHOST will attempt to provide physical Green Hydrogen at cost + delta basis, using the best supply chain configuration, for the following `acts of good`:

  -  Cleaning ocean oil-spills, plastics, and other pollutants in a scientifically open, least cost least residual method.
  -  Saving people's life at sea, providing safe economical replacement for heating for low-income people who are disproportionaly lost in home-heating accidents,  working towards human habitable self-sufficient energy islands for various refugees.
  -  Education of students in Hydrogen welding and glass annealing, world-wide.
  -  Fuel needs of USA armed forces in line of duty.   

## Location

The GHOST is looking for a suitable place to haunt.


The GHOST is created with the hope that Green Hydrogen Technologies will improve with collaborative scientific accretion.  With a transparent cost structure, a well defined rational process for planetary scale decarbonization may be followed, as the scale of Hydrogen production grows.
